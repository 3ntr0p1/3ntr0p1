    <h2>Tests on time-independence</h2>
    <p>By definition, fundamental physical constants are subject to measurement, so that their being constant 
        (independent on both the time and position of the performance of the measurement) 
        is necessarily an experimental result and subject to verification.</p>
    <p>Paul Dirac in 1937 speculated that physical constants such as the gravitational 
        constant or the fine-structure constant might be subject to change over time in 
        proportion of the age of the universe. Experiments can in principle only put an 
        upper bound on the relative change per year. For the fine-structure constant, 
        this upper bound is comparatively low, at roughly 10<sup><small>−17</small></sup> per year (as of 2008).</p>
    <p>The gravitational constant is much more difficult to measure with precision, 
        and conflicting measurements in the 2000s have inspired the controversial suggestions 
        of a periodic variation of its value in a 2015 paper. However, while its value 
        is not known to great precision, the possibility of observing type Ia supernovae 
        which happened in the universe's remote past, paired with the assumption that the 
        physics involved in these events is universal, allows for an upper bound of less 
        than 10<sup><small>−10</small></sup> per year for the gravitational constant over the last nine billion years.</p>
    <p>Similarly, an upper bound of the change in the proton-to-electron mass ratio has been placed 
        at 10<sup><small>−7</small></sup> over a period of 7 billion years (or 10<sup><small>−16</small></sup> per year) in a 2012 study based on the 
        observation of methanol in a distant galaxy.</p>
    <p>It is problematic to discuss the proposed rate of change (or lack thereof) of a single 
        dimensional physical constant in isolation. The reason for this is that the choice of 
        units is arbitrary, making the question of whether a constant is undergoing change an 
        artefact of the choice (and definition) of the units.</p>
    <p>For example, in SI units, the speed of light was given a defined value in 1983. Thus, 
        it was meaningful to experimentally measure the speed of light in SI units prior to 1983, 
        but it is not so now. Similarly, with effect from May 2019, the Planck constant has a 
        defined value, such that all SI base units are now defined in terms of fundamental physical 
        constants. With this change, the international prototype of the kilogram is being retired as 
        the last physical object used in the definition of any SI unit.</p>
    <p>Tests on the immutability of physical constants look at dimensionless quantities, 
        i.e. ratios between quantities of like dimensions, in order to escape this problem. 
        Changes in physical constants are not meaningful if they result in an observationally 
        indistinguishable universe. For example, a "change" in the speed of light c would be meaningless 
        if accompanied by a corresponding change in the elementary charge <b><i>e</i></b> so that the ratio <i>e<sup><small>2</small></sup> / (4πε0ħc)</i>
        (the fine-structure constant) remained unchanged.</p>
